I was told to make my way onto the cruise ship avoiding detection. 
Once aboard I am to rendezvous with Agent Scarlet Beetle 
as she has been tracking the target for some time 
and will provide me with everything I need. 
I will work with the Green Order for now, but once I know where the weapon is I will destroy it for Rise
I have listening devices that can help me locate objects. 
//possible controls: Interact, Move, Dash, Sneak, Run, Back, ListenBug, OpenMenu
I can use %interact% to interact with people or objects.
I can use %dash% to dash.
I can use %move% to move around. 
I can use %run% to run and %sneak% to sneak. 
To listen to a placed bug, I can use %listenbug%
I can use %back% for canceling dialogues.
