# introMonologue
! 
C.R. Piller: Now that I'm on the ship, I need to find Scarlet.

# cantUseStairs
? cantUseStairs
C.R. Piller: I can't use these stairs.. I have to find different way to get upstairs.

# Monologue when Piller finds Weapon
C.R. Piller: I found it! But it's so big, we can't get it off the ship ourselves!
C.R. Piller: There is no way this weapon can do good in the hands of the UG, they will rule the world. 
C.R. Piller: But if I destroy it, maybe the seas will continue to rise. What do I do D:!

# weaponDestroyed
? finishLevel
C.R. Piller: I'm going to destroy the weapon now. Maybe we can build it again in time, better that
than handing the world to people that caused this mess.

# weaponLeft
? finishLevelAlt
C.R. Piller: I'm going to leave the weapon. If I destroy it then everyone could die anyway. Resisting will be harder now. 

# firstMeetScarlet
!
Scarlet Beatle: It’s pleasant to set my eyes on you again Cat.
C.R. Piller: And you Beetle, Scarlet Beatle.
Scarlet Beatle: (Blush) Ok agent, here is our mission. The spy I am tracking is probably a male in his 30s.
Scarlet Beatle: We know he eats cheese sticks.
Scarlet Beatle: We think he was the cause of the theft of Weapon X. X was a tool created over many 
Scarlet Beatle: years to reverse climate change, but we have intel that UG plan only to use it to 
Scarlet Beatle: dominate more - climate change suits them. Your mission is to find it and capture it.
Scarlet Beatle: Use your listening bug to find him and find where he has hidden weapon is. 
Scarlet Beatle: Take this key, it will help you get to locations around the ship.
C.R. Piller: I’ll find it. You can count on me. 
Scarlet Beatle: We all do. Be safe.
